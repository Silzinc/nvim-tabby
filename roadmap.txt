- Correct FIM (take inspiration from other plugins ?)
  - Use the `range` param in the response items to break response `insertText` into suffix and prefix.
    In the end, we should have `insertText == prefix .. text_in_range .. suffix`. Set prefix to be
    empty if range is empty.

    `range` has the form `{ start: { line: number, character: number }, end: { line: number, character: number } }`,
    where each number if 1-based (see https://github.com/TabbyML/tabby/blob/ca4f90087fe8eb58fa847aed5a2c4e78e7b7adc8/clients/tabby-agent/src/codeCompletion/solution.ts#L81 and
    https://github.com/TabbyML/tabby/blob/main/clients/tabby-chat-panel/src/types.ts#L4).

  - Create two extmarks, one for prefix (if not empty) and another one for suffix.
  - When accepting a word, a prefix one is accepted, except if the prefix is already emptied.
    In that case, a suffix word is accepted.
  - When accepting a line, if the prefix exists, the prefix should only be in the first line,
    and therefore it should be fully accepted and the suffix should get the behaviour of the normal
    completion text from then on.
  - When doing accepting a full completion, accept prefix and suffix altogether.

- Try to highlight virtual text with treesitter

- Document default config
